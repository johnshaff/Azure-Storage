## Understanding Azure Fileshare

A file share in Azure is a storage resource you can use to store files in the cloud, similar to a file share on a network in your local environment. Specifically, an Azure File Share is part of Azure Files, which provides fully managed cloud file storage that can be accessed via the SMB protocol or REST APIs.
